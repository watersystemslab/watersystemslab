Water Systems Lab at UMass Amherst
Water for the Common Wealth
The Water Systems Lab, led by Dr. Emily Kumpel in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, is a research group studying water infrastructure, systems, and people, from intermittently supplied cities in India to small systems in rural Alaska and Massachusetts.
Our work connects technical measurements of water quality and supply reliability to public health outcomes, regulatory practice, and policy.
